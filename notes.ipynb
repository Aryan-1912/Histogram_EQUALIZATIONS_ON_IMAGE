    "Green Channel Has Very Low Frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "If the image (like your kitty.jpg) is mostly dominated by dark colors, shadows, or blue/red tones, the green channel might contribute very little, resulting in a nearly flat or hidden green curve.\n",

    "Green Curve Is Overlapped\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "‚úÖ Final Diagnosis:\n",
    "The green histogram is being overlapped by the blue and red curves, especially around lower intensities (0‚Äì50).\n",
